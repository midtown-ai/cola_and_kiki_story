    { images: ['2-1.webp', '2-2.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `But every time she closed her eyes, she was kept awake by the loud, excited chatter of a Kookaburra named Kiki.\n\n"Cola, you won't believe what I just discovered!" Kiki exclaimed. "There is a new AI club starting in the forest, and I want you to join me!"` },
    { images: ['3-1.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `Cola groaned and rubbed her eyes. She wasn't interested in any club. She just wanted to sleep. But Kiki wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\n"Come on, Cola, let's go there together. It will be so much fun!" Kiki suggested. "We will learn about AI and all the amazing things it can do."` },
    { images: ['3-2.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `"No, thank you," Cola said politely. "I prefer to nap in my tree."\n\nBut Kiki wasn't about to give up. He started jumping up and down on Cola's tree, making all the leaves shake and rustle.\n\n"Wake up, wake up, Cola!" Kiki sang. "Don't you want to expand your knowledge and keep up with the latest technology?"` },
    { images: ['4-1.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `Cola couldn't take it anymore. She climbed down from her tree and gave Kiki a stern look.\n\n"Kiki, I'm sorry, but I really need my rest," Cola said firmly. "I'm a Koala, and sleeping is what we do. So please, please, please... let me sleep in peace."\n\nKiki finally gave up and nodded. "Okay, Cola. I'll let you sleep" he said with a grin. "But just know, you will be missing our on a lot of fun and exciting opportunities"` },
    { images: ['5-1.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `Cola smiled and climbed back up into her tree. She settled into her cozy eucalyptus leaves and closed her eyes.\n\nAnd finally, after all the noise and excitement, Cola was able to drift off into a peaceful, dreamy sleep.` },

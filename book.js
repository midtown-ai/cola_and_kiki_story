Kiki exclaimed. "There is a new AI club starting in the forest!"\n\n"Kiki, please stop that racket!" Colah begged. "I'm trying to sleep!"\n\nBut excited Kiki couldn't stop. "Sleep, sleep, who needs sleep?" he cackled. "Come and join me instead!"` },
    { images: ['3-1.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `Colah groaned and rubbed her eyes. She wasn't interested in any club, she just wanted to sleep. But Kiki wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\n"Come on, Colah, let's go there together!" Kiki suggested.\n\n"Kiki, I appreciate the offer" Collah said politely. "But I prefer to take a nap in my tree."` },
    { images: ['3-2.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `"No, thank you," Colah said politely. "I prefer to nap in my tree."\n\nBut Kiki wasn't about to give up. He started jumping up and down on Colah's tree, making all the leaves shake and rustle.\n\n"Wake up, wake up, Colah!" Kiki sang. "There's a whole world out there to see!"` },
    { images: ['4-1.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `Colah couldn't take it anymore. She climbed down from her tree and gave Kiki a stern look.\n\n"Kiki, I'm sorry, but I really need my rest," Colah said firmly. "I'm a Koala, and sleeping is what we do. So please, let me sleep in peace."\n\nKiki finally stopped laughing and looked at Colah with a sheepish grin. "Oh, I'm sorry, Colah," he said. "I didn't realize you were so tired. I'll let you sleep now."` },
    { images: ['5-1.webp'], textPosition: 'bottom', text: `Colah smiled and climbed back up into her tree. She settled into her cozy eucalyptus leaves and closed her eyes.\n\nAnd finally, after all the noise and excitement, Colah was able to drift off into a peaceful, dreamy sleep. The end.` },
